He currently lives in California and whenever he visits, I take him to new foodie places in Arizona. After visiting Churn, he said he LOVED this place, and so do I! The flavors are simple, which is great for people like us who love everything but are indecisive. They lack crazy flavors unlike most ice cream chains, but each flavor is so fresh and delicious on its own that it doesn't need anything else! The ice cream cookie sandwiches are our favorite - the ice cream stays cold while the cookie gives it a bit of crunchy goodness. My personal favorite is chocolate chip mint on a chocolate brownie cookie. I was seeing stars (and that's a good thing)! The shop is small, yes, and parking is very limited, but that's what makes this place so special. You're there to get ice cream and enjoy it outside. Even if it's cold or blazing hot, you're in love with Churn's ice cream and after you're done, you're going to want to walk through and look at the toys and goodies they sell there.
