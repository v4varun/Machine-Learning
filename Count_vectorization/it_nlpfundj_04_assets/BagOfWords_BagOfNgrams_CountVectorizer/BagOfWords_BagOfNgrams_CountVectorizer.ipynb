It treats text as an unordered set of words, ignoring grammar, syntax, and word order, and focuses solely on the frequency of words within a document or a collection of documents. The key idea behind the Bag of Words model is to represent text data as a \"bag\" or \"multiset\" of words, where each word is treated as a unique feature.\n","\n","Advantages of the Bag of Words model:\n","\n","Simplicity and ease of implementation.\n","Suitable for various text classification and analysis tasks.\n","Can handle large text corpora efficiently.\n","Disadvantages of the Bag of

the traditional Bag of Words (BoW) model in natural language processing (NLP). While the BoW model represents text as a collection of individual words, the Bag of N-grams model takes into account sequences of words, known as \"n-grams,\" to capture some degree of word order and local context information.\n","\n","Instead of considering individual words, the model considers sequences of \"n\" consecutive words as units. These units are called \"n-grams.\" Common choices for \"n\" include 2 (bigrams), 3 (trigrams), or even higher values, depending on the desired level of context.\n","\n","The Bag of N-grams model offers advantages over the traditional Bag of Words model by capturing some level of word order and local context information. For example, if you use bigrams (2-grams), you can capture adjacent word pairs in the text, which may help in tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and information retrieval.\n","\n","Advantages of the Bag of N-grams model:\n","\n","Captures some degree of word order and local context.\n","Can be effective for tasks that rely on word associations or collocations.\n","Flexible, as you can adjust the value of \"n\" to control the level of context.\n","Disadvantages of the Bag of N-grams model:\n","\n","Higher dimensionality compared to the traditional Bag of Words.\n","Still lacks a complete understanding of sentence or document structure.\n","Limited in capturing long-range dependencies in text.\n","The choice of \"n\" (the size of n-grams) is a hyperparameter that depends on the specific NLP task and dataset. Smaller values of \"n\" capture shorter local context, while larger values capture longer sequences of words. The Bag of N-grams model is a useful technique for text analysis when you want to consider sequences of words beyond individual terms."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"6a24e918","metadata":{"id":"6a24e918","outputId":"1b9e1b4a-882b-4efa-f800-1f3c9077c0aa"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<style>#sk-container-id-3 {color: black;}#sk-container-id-3 pre{padding: 0;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-toggleable {background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-3 label.sk-toggleable__label {cursor: pointer;display: block;width: 100%;margin-bottom: 0;padding: 0.3em;box-sizing: border-box;text-align: center;}#sk-container-id-3 label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:before {content: \"▸\";float: left;margin-right: 0.25em;color: #696969;}#sk-container-id-3 label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:hover:before {color: black;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-estimator:hover label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:before {color: black;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-toggleable__content {max-height: 0;max-width: 0;overflow: hidden;text-align: left;background-color: #f0f8ff;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-toggleable__content pre {margin: 0.2em;color: black;border-radius: 0.25em;background-color: #f0f8ff;}#sk-container-id-3 input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~div.sk-toggleable__content {max-height: 200px;max-width: 100%;overflow: auto;}#sk-container-id-3 input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:before {content: \"▾\";}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-estimator input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~label.sk-toggleable__label {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-label input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~label.sk-toggleable__label {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-3 input.sk-hidden--visually {border: 0;clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);height: 1px;margin: -1px;overflow: hidden;padding: 0;position: absolute;width: 1px;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-estimator {font-family: monospace;background-color: #f0f8ff;border: 1px dotted black;border-radius: 0.25em;box-sizing: border-box;margin-bottom: 0.5em;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-estimator:hover {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-parallel-item::after {content: \"\";width: 100%;border-bottom: 1px solid gray;flex-grow: 1;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-label:hover label.sk-toggleable__label {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-serial::before {content: \"\";position: absolute;border-left: 1px solid gray;box-sizing: border-box;top: 0;bottom: 0;left: 50%;z-index: 0;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-serial {display: flex;flex-direction: column;align-items: center;background-color: white;padding-right: 0.2em;padding-left: 0.2em;position: relative;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-item {position: relative;z-index: 1;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-parallel {display: flex;align-items: stretch;justify-content: center;background-color: white;position: relative;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-item::before, #sk-container-id-3 div.sk-parallel-item::before {content: \"\";position: absolute;border-left: 1px solid gray;box-sizing: border-box;top: 0;bottom: 0;left: 50%;z-index: -1;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-parallel-item {display: flex;flex-direction: column;z-index: 1;position: relative;background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-parallel-item:first-child::after {align-self: flex-end;width: 50%;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-parallel-item:last-child::after {align-self: flex-start;width: 50%;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-parallel-item:only-child::after {width: 0;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-dashed-wrapped {border: 1px dashed gray;margin: 0 0.4em 0.5em 0.4em;box-sizing: border-box;padding-bottom: 0.4em;background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-label label {font-family: monospace;font-weight: bold;display: inline-block;line-height: 1.2em;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-label-container {text-align: center;}#sk-container-id-3 div.sk-container {/* jupyter's `normalize.less` sets `[hidden] { display: none; }` but bootstrap.min.css set `[hidden] { display: none !important; }` so we also need the `!important` here to be able to override the default hidden behavior on the sphinx rendered scikit-learn.org.
